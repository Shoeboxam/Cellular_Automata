Cellular Automata
============================

Elementary Cellular Automata  
A cascading bit pattern generated by recursively pairing the eight bits of a byte to the eight permutations of a binary triplet.  

The Renderer class accepts Automata objects and produces a pannable, zoomable window. Various other, optional algorithms and automata are included as well.
